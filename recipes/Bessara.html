    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Moroccan Bissara is a traditional Moroccan soup made from dried split fava beans. It is a hearty and nutritious dish that's often enjoyed during the colder months.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dry fava beans</li>
        <li>1 cup dry split peas</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add your dry fava beans and split peas to a large pot. Add 4 to 6 cups of water or just add enough to completely submerge your beans/peas. Place your pot on your stove at medium-high heat and add cumin, paprika, turmeric powder, salt and olive oil. Using the palm of your hand, crush your garlic cloves, peel and add them to the pot.</li>
        <li>Bring your pot to a boil, cover and lower the heat to medium-low. Let cook for 30-35 minutes. Once your beans are broken down turn the heat off and let your pot cool down for about 10 minutes. Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until you get a smooth texture.</li>
        <li>To garnish, add a drizzle of olive oil, some cumin and some hot cayenne powder if you're feeling bold. Serve with a slice of bread and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

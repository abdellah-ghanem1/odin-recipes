    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Zaalouk is a popular Moroccan cooked salad of eggplants and tomatoes seasoned with paprika, cumin, garlic, and herbs. Roasting the eggplants is an optional but recommended step for adding a layer of smoky flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 - 14 oz eggplant, charred (approx. 2 lg)</li>
        <li>½ oz extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to grease</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>14 ½ oz canned diced tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp paprika</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt, to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ tsp ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>½ tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>parsley leaves, to garnish</li>
        <li>cilantro leaves, to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Eggplant and Tomatoes:</strong> Roast or grill 2-3 eggplants until the skin is charred and the flesh is soft. Simultaneously, roast 2-3 tomatoes until the skin blisters and can be easily peeled.</li>
        <li><strong>Peel and Mash:</strong>  Allow the roasted eggplants and tomatoes to cool slightly, then peel the charred skin from both. Afterward, mash the peeled eggplants and tomatoes together in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong> Cook with Spices:</strong>  Heat some olive oil in a pan and add 2-3 minced garlic cloves along with Moroccan spices like cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper to taste. Stir in the mashed eggplant and tomato mixture.</li>
        <li><strong> Simmer and Blend:</strong>  Let the mixture simmer for approximately 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the mixture to thicken. Then, use a blender or a hand blender to blend the mixture to your preferred consistency.</li>
        <li><strong> Finish and Serve:</strong>  Season the blended mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh cilantro and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve your Moroccan Zaalouk as a dip or side dish with bread or crackers.</li>
    </ol>
